HISTORY
=======

1.3 - Unreleased
----------------

- Changed default css file to use css3 viewport units and some minor Layout
  changes.

- View and preview on speaker console now try to use the publics ratio of
  width to height.

- Added multilanguage support. Now german as well as english available.
  Language depends on the browsers language setting. Default remains english.

- Detecting next slide changed to manage more komplex html documents where
  the html elements may be in differnt branches of the DOM tree.

- In cases when the speaker console can not be opend a button overlay is
  showen on top. Open the window by clicking this button. This can help when
  Firefox prevents a not interactive windows.open.

- Added a message whether the preview showes a following slide or wheather you
  are returning the pressentation.

- Added additional css-files impressConsoleBlack.css, impressConsoleDark.css
  and impressConsoleGray.css. They all include impressConsole.css. Give
  css-file to init. Example:
  impressConsole().init('CSS/impressConsoleGray.css');



1.2 - 2014-12-04
----------------

- Using the name "console" for the console cause a name conflict. It has been
  renamed to "impressConsole".

- Added a 'impress-console' css style to the preview windows, so you can style
  the previews separately, for example disabling transitions.


1.1 - 2013-02-19
----------------

- Fixed a bug with Firefox, where the console on opening would have the
  upper right corner in the center of the slide.


1.0 - 2012-12-19
----------------

- Added a "Ready/Working" status flag.

- The open() call now takes a parameter, css, so you can specify another
  css-file used for the console. This is primarily used so that you can have
  so you can include impress-console in tools and themes with more freedom.

- Made the default font-size smaller, as I tended to have to zoom out.

- Changed the key to open the console from <N> to <P>, because Landslide uses
  <N> to toggle slide numbers.

- Improved key-handling (with inspiration from Landslide, once again) so that
  modified key-presses doesn't trigger slide changes in the console-window.

- Added a registerKeyEvent convenience function.

- Better behavior on Firefox.

- <space> is now the default mover to "next". If there is more text that can
  be displayed in the notes-window, <space> will scroll down. Otherwise it
  will move to the next slide.

- The iframe blocker didn't actually block all of the iframes.


1.0b2 - 2012-04-01
------------------

- The "pre-loading" of notes loaded the wrong notes.

- Added key handlers in the console, so that navigation works even if the
  console window has focus. Tab is not supported, as that will trigger
  the next slide also when you Alt-Tab in some browsers, which is extremely
  annoying.

- The windows in the presenter console will now move in sync with the main
  window (unless you move to a step before the previous one has finished
  moving, in which case the presenter console will fall behind).


1.0b1 - 2012-03-30
------------------

- Initial release.
